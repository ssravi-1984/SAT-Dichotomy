            Complexity of  Succinctly Specified Problems

We study the complexity and efficient approximability of various decision,
counting and optimization problems when instances are specified using 

(1) the 1-dimensional finite periodic narrow specifications of 
Wanke \cite{Wa93}, 

(2) the 2-way infinite 1-dimensional narrow
periodic (sometimes called dynamic) specifications 
of Karp and Orlin  et al. \cite{KMW67,Or82a},  and 


(3) the hierarchical specification language of Lengauer et al. 
Le86,LW87a,Le88,Le89,LW92.



We outline how  
generalized CNF satisfiability problems 
and {\bf local} reductions
can be used to obtain {\bf both} hardness and easiness results for
a number of decision, counting, optimization and approximate optimization
problems when instances are specified as in (1), (2) or (3). 

As corollaries we obtain a number of new
PSPACE-hardness and  #PSPACE-hardness results
and  a number of new
polynomial time approximation algorithms for natural PSPACE-hard 
optimization problems. In particular assuming P <> PSPACE, 
we characterize
completely the complexities of the generalized CNF satisfiability problems
SAT(S) of Schaefer Sc78, when instances are specified
as in (1), (2) or (3).
Our results answer  open questions raised in  CF+93,La89,LW92,Or84b
and significantly extend the results in LW92,HMS94,Or82a,Zu93.
